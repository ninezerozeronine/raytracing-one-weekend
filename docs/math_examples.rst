   (\vec{A} \cdot \vec{B}) \cdot \vec{C}

This some text with an inline bit of maths in it, are you ready? Here
it comes :math:`\frac{ \sum_{t=0}^{N}f(t,k) }{N}` and now we carry on
as if nothing happened.

:math:`\vec{R}` is the vector from the centre (:math:`C`) to a point (:math:`P`) // To travel from the centre to a point we first go from the centre to the origin (:math:`- C`), then from the origin to the point (:math:`+ P`)) - the terms are re-arragend to make things look a little nicer. 

If :math:`\vec{R}` is the vector from the center to a point on the sphere, and :math:`r` is the radius then if :math:`\vec{R} \odot \vec{R} = r^2` the point is on the sphere.




Everyone loves the quadratic equation!

.. math::

   x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}

A funky equation array thing:

.. math::
   :nowrap:

   \begin{eqnarray}
      y    & = & ax^2 + bx + c \\
      f(x) & = & x^2 + 2xy + y^2
   \end{eqnarray}
